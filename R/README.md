# R Code Portfolio

This repository contains a selection of R Markdown files from relative coursework. These examples demonstrate a range of data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques, reflecting my skills in R for data science and analytics.

## Featured Skills

The following skills are demonstrated in this portfolio:

- **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Proficient in data cleaning, transformation, and preparation using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Experienced in descriptive statistics, data visualization, and summarizing data insights.
- **Statistical Analysis and Resampling**: Skilled in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and bootstrap resampling methods.
- **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**: Conducted ARIMA modeling and time series forecasting for temporal data insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented clustering techniques like K-means and dimensionality reduction methods.
- **Regression Modeling**: Applied both simple and multivariate regression models, with diagnostics and variable selection.
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative visualizations using `ggplot2` to effectively communicate analytical results.
